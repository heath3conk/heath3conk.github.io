Project.create!(title: "Good Day Mate", short_description: "Capstone project at DevBootcamp. In eight days, our four-person team produced a mobile-first app using React.js. Our goal was to create a way to reflect on the day just finished, express gratitude and anticipate good things for the following day. Users set up a stream of things to see/do to begin their day. In the morning, they review their entries of the previous night and dive into the customized stream they had created, maybe reading headlines, listening to a podcast or seeing a truly terrible geeky joke.
