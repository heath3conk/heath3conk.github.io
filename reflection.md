#My Website Reflection

**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I have a couple of elements that are meant to sit side-by-side so the difference between padding and margin became clearer to me by seeing how those properties showed up differently. For some things, like how the text inside those elements looked, padding worked better. For others, like where the border sits, margin worked. 

It was also interesting playing around with where I put those properties in terms of inherited attributes, such as placing them in the <body> tag versus a <div> tag.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
Mainly that I need to keep working on this! Some things appeared the way I expected them to and others didn't. On my home page, I kept trying to figure out why a section wasn't falling below my picture the way I thought it should and then I realized that the <header> section which contains that image was shorter than the image itself. 

I haven't tried any absolute or relative positioning on these pages yet but I want to ty those out to see if they'll be more intuitive than the brute-force manipulation I've done so far.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
The easiest aspects were things like text alignment, font color and what seems like really basic stuff. 

The most difficult thing - namely the thing I haven't yet figured out - was setting a different background-color inside certain elements. I thought it would go like this: set a univeral background-color and then, add a class to a <div> let's say, set a different background-color. Then (I thoguht) any other element inside that <div class="new-color">, such as a table or a link, would have the new color. That didn't seem to be how it worked. In the end, I had to sprinkle a bg-color class throughout the whole <div> to make it work. I still think there's a better way but will have to save that research for next week.

Also, on a completely different side of things, I kept waffling on my color palette. I'm not totally fixed on the one I've got set up here. It is at least the fourth set of colors I tried (thank you Adobe color wheel for hours of fun!)


**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
- I learned to take my time and, usually, to not get frustrated when things don't turn out the way I think they will on the first attempt.
- I also learned what an absolute time warp this is! I did practice timeboxing on this, as suggested. If I hadn't, you'd probably find me sitting here a month from now, hungry and covered in cobwebs, still fooling around with this.
