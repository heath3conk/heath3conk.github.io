        or four posts. Don't know how to do that yet.

        It should also be located in a narrow-ish section on the right side of the page
        next to the current blog post.

        Besides the positioning, it'll have a different background color or texture
        to differentiate it from the main content of this page.

      How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      I enjoyed this challenge. It was nice to see what my pair had created for his wireframe, which was very similar to my own. I liked the process of writing HTML together on JSFiddle since it gave us two sets of eyes on the code to make sure we weren't leaving out tags or whatever.

      Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
      I did find it helpful, pretty much like outlining a paper to be written. 

      What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
      We talked about using HTML tags in a way that their role on the page is clear, referencing the semantics articles we've been reading. We were trying to dilineate the sections so that it would be clear that they were different things. We tried to use <div> tags to create a "sidebar" and "content" areas on the page but we couldn't figure out quite how to display them the way we wanted to. The idea is there so we can go in and add CSS elements later. I put notes in those spots so I would remember what I wanted to do once I have more skills.
      
      What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
      We used <section> tags here, which we hadn't earlier. Tried to use <div> tags but, since I don't know how to put one <div> on the right side of the page and another <div> parallel on the left side, my content just overlapped. The references I consulted to see about using columns or grids suggested these were CSS tools so I stayed away. Looking forward to learning how to do that!
