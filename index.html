    Contact is just a straight link to the page that shows my contact info.

    Don't know if I really need Search or not but, what the heck, thought I'd throw it in there for now.

        <h3 class="subheading">I make things simple</h3>
        <p>While I'm eating breakfast, I often think about what I might have for dinner. It's not because I'm constantly hungry, I just like to plan things in advance. At this point, it's hard to say whether that tendency is due to my nearly 20 years as a financial planner or whether that work seemed right to me because it suited my nature. I like to look for the big picture and try to figure out how it got that way.</p>

        <p>My bachelors degree is in Linguistics from Douglass College at Rutgers University. As obscure as that field of study may seem, it was excellent training for understanding how the constiuent parts of a larger body interact, which has turned out to be very useful throughout my varied career. As an undergrad, I was finding phonemes that differentiate words; as a financial planner, I was evaluating securities that provide real diversification in a portfolio; as a web developer it is about putting together elements of a website that lead to excellent user experiences.</p>

        <p>I worked in the financial industry from 1995 until 2015, most of that time as a Certified Financial Planner<sup>&reg;</sup>. I helped families identify what is important to them about money and how to approach their finances from a feeling of abundance rather than fear. </p>

        <p>One of the most important things I learned from my planning experience is that most of the time, we're asking people the wrong questions when we ask them about money. This meshes with another thing I learned as a Linguistics major: context and intent matter. In web development, it means that one person's perfect app is not necessarily ideal for someone else.</p>

        <p>My job is to help you quantify what you want your website to do, identify how you expect people to interact with you and produce a truly impactful user experience.</p>

        I'm not sure I'll leave this as a list or what. Need to go look at some professionals' pages and see how/whether they show thumbnails of past projects...www.awwwards.com/websites/portfolio/ Okay, now my site looks sooooo boring.
