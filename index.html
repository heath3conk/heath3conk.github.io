    <!-- Portfolio, Blog and Links should all be drop-down lists that display the underlying links. It would be great if clicking on Portfolio or Blog took you straight to those index pages as well.

    Contact is just a straight link to the page that shows my contact info.

    Don't know if I really need Search or not but, what the heck, thought I'd throw it in there for now.

        I'm not sure I'll leave this as a list or what. Need to go look at some professionals' pages and see how/whether they show thumbnails of past projects...www.awwwards.com/websites/portfolio/ Okay, now my site looks sooooo boring.
