         3      baked_goods: ["toast", "muffin", "coffee cake"],
         4      cereal: ["granola", "Capn Crunch"],
         5      griddle: ["pancakes", "french toast", "hash browns"],

        <td>
          <p>
          Objects can also hold other objects and/or functions. The properties inside the object are separated by commas. The property names can be formatted like symbols in Ruby, without quotes and followed by a colon, as is <span class="ital">breakfast:</span> on line 2 and <span class="ital">soup</span> on line 10.
          </p>
          <p>
          The properties and their values function like key/value pairs in a Ruby hash.
          </p>

      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>

        14  meals.dinner = {};
        15  meals.dinner.entrees = ["roast chicken", "meatloaf", "pork chops", "veggie lasagne"];
        16
        17  console.log(meals.dinner);

         => { entrees: [ 'roast chicken', 'meatloaf', 'pork chops', 'veggie lasagne' ] }

        </code></pre>
        </td>

        <td>
          The <span class="ital">meals</span> object contains properties that are themselves objects. To add another one first requires that you show it is an object and give it a name (line 1). Then you can provide the new <span class="ital">entrees</span> properties its own value (line 2).
      	</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre><code>
        18  console.log(meals["breakfast"]["baked_goods"][1]);
        19  console.log(meals.breakfast.baked_goods[1]);
        20  console.log(meals[breakfast][baked_goods][1]);

         =>  muffin
         =>  muffin
         =>  ReferenceError: breakfast is not defined
         </code></pre>
         </td>

         <td>
         <p>
         The first two lines are valid ways to access entries in a object. Either the bracket notation on line or the dot notation on line 2 work fine. Both print the value <span class="ital">muffin</span> to the screen.
         </p>

         <p>
         The third line raises an error that <span class="ital">breakfast</span> is not defined. (It would raise the same error for <span class="ital">baked_goods,</span> if it got that far.)
         </p>

<!-- 
What content was solidified in the process of completing this challenge?
	The main part of objects I've been struggling with this week is calling them up with
	dot and/or bracket notation. I wanted to play around with that in a simplified way so I 
	could see what happened when I tried the various notation over the same object. I feel 
	more comfortable with getting the values I'm looking for as well as adding properties
	and values to an object.

What content do you feel a bit fuzzy on still?
	I purposely didn't go too deeply into objects because I was trying to get really clear
	on just a couple of aspects of them. There are a lot of parts of JavaScript that are
	stil a bit fuzzy to me.

What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
	Time boxing! I got part way into the cheat sheet and decided I didn't like how my 
	code blocks looked. That lead to 90 minutes of fooling around with colors across my
	entire site. I do like the look better but it was time spent on window-dressing 
	rather than content.

Has your ability to add CSS to format and position objects improved since week 3?
	Definitely! I did this challenge over two days and, after leaving it alone for a 
	couple of hours after the first part, I realized that I just needed to use a table to 
	make it look the way I wanted it. Implementing that was simple. So I'm getting better
	at identifying how to achieve what I want without spending too much time spinning my
	wheels.

	The instructions say to create a custom CSS file for this and I did that but I was just 
	repeating thngs that were on my blog stylesheet. In the end, I got rid of the new
	stylesheet and just referenced the one for my blog.
