        <h2>Arrays & Hashes</h2>
        <h3>Organization!</h3>
        <h4>January 3, 2016</h4>
        <p>
          In the physical world, I'm a fairly organized person. My books are arranged according to the room they're in, genre and how much I love them (cookbooks in the kitchen, most, <span class="bold">most</span> favorite books in my bedroom, so that I could reach them if I were deathly ill). DVDs go by genre and vintage. You get the idea. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In the virtual world, organization is even more essential. You won't be able to find your favorite blog post in your home directory by recognizing the font of its title on the shelf. So you create folders and put things in some kind of logical order.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you go down into smaller and smaller environments - from a condo to a computer to a Ruby program that's supposed to get something done - the need to keep things in some kind of logical order doesn't go away. With code, you've got several ways to get that done. 
        </p>

        <p>
          You might need to have a single piece of information that you'll use in some way (or several ways). For that, you'd probably have a variable set to a single value. For example, maybe you'd have a variable called <span class="ital">first_name</span>. You might have a simple bit of code that asks the user to input their name and you'd store their input in that variable. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, suppose you wanted to keep track of everyone who uses your simple bit of code. You'd want to collect their <span class="ital">first_name</span> entries into a list you could go back to at a later time. An <span class="bold">array</span> is ideal for this purpose. Arrays are just collections of data. In this example, not only would your array maintain a list of users' names, it would also be able to show you the order in which they answered your question. That's because arrays are <span class="ital">ordered</span> lists. Every element in an array has a specific position, or <span class="ital">index.</span> The index of a given name would indicate whether that person used your <span class="ital">name_grabber</span> before or after someone else. 
        </p>

        <p>
          After a few people have come by, your array might look like this:
          <span class="code_snippet">
          visitors = ["Heather", "Will", "Cathleen"]
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose though that you wanted more information than just the user's name? Maybe you want their <span class="ital">last_name</span> and <span class="ital">birthday</span> too. A <span class="bold">hash</span> could keep this information for you. A hash differs from an array in that the data in a hash comes in pairs of a <span class="ital">key</span> and a <span class="ital">value.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          A hash for my information would look like this:
          <span class="code_snippet">
          {"first_name" => "Heather", "last_name" => "Conklin", "birthday" => "December 16"}</span>
          The beauty of the hash is that the relationships between the data points is so obvious. Clearly, my birthday is December 16. If the key <span class="ital">birthday</span> weren't right there, you might wonder what that date was all about. But that's not a problem with hashes. If you were looking at the information my sister input instead of me, the hash would be:
          <span class="code_snippet">
          {"first_name" => "Cathleen", "last_name" => "Feduke", "birthday" => "May 7"}
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          One important note here, the <span class="ital">keys</span> in a hash are unique. You can't have two <span class="ital">first_name</span> entries in the hash. <span class="ital">Values</span> can repeat though, so if my brother's name were "Will Will," his hash would be: 
          <span class="code_snippet">
          {"first_name" => "Will", "last_name" => "Will", "birthday" => "June 1"}
          </span>
        </p>
              
        <p>
          Now, here's where it gets really good (for someone like me who kind of wishes she owned a label-maker). Both <span class="bold">arrays</span> and <span class="bold">hashes</span> can hold anything. Strings, integers, <span class="ital">other arrays or hashes</span>, anything, even combinations of different types of things. So, if I wanted to keep track of all the people who've interacted with my <span class="ital">name_grabber</span> code, I might organize it like this:
         <span class="code_snippet">
          visitors_hash = [{"first_name" => "Heather", "last_name" => "Conklin", "birthday" => "December 16"}, {"first_name" => "Cathleen", "last_name" => "Feduke", "birthday" => "May 7"}, {"first_name" => "Will", "last_name" => "Will", "birthday" => "June 1"}]
        </span>
         Notice the different brackets: arrays use <span class="bold">[]</span> while hashes use <span class="bold">{}</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is an array whose elements are hashes! I can iterate over the array to find the hash whose <span class="ital">first_name</span> key holds a value of "Cathleen" and return the value in her <span class="ital">birthday</span> key. Both arrays and hashes have built-in methods for finding information they hold, adding and removing elements, rearranging their contents and otherwise using the data in them (which is really the point).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          There are circumstances where it's obvious which of these collections is the "best" way to hold your data and others where you could probably use either. I haven't come across that many circumstances up to this point so I don't have a lot of examples to look at. For the moment, I'm thinking of it this way: If I need to emphasize a <span class="bold">relationship</span> between the question I'm asking and the answer I'm getting, then I have a key (the question) and a value (answer) and a hash might be the collection for that task. Otherwise, an array would probably work fine.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In this particular example, you might argue that an array of arrays would be equally efficient, since the three pieces of data I want are all the same and show up in the same order each time. If I wanted to, I could create an array of values for each visitor and build up an array made up of other arrays, like this:
          <span class="code_snippet">
          visitors_array = [["Heather", "Conklin", "December 16"], ["Cathleen", "Feduke", "May 7"], ["Will", "Will", "June 1"]]
          </span>
          Note that the keys are gone as are the "=>" markers. I could still iterate through these arrays, find "Cathleen" and return "May 7" for her birthday, based on that string's position in the array that starts with her name. 
        </p>
